# DFM Browser Extension - Firefox Edition (1.3)
A simple extension for Mozilla Firefox that displays the queue for a Discord.FM library of your choice!

# How do I install it?
You really can't just yet. Apparently you cannot install extensions that haven't been verified by the peeps at Mozilla. So we're waiting for verification. I'll keep ya'll updated. Until then, we wait for the 121 other people in queue in front of me.
